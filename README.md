Enabling friendly URLs for CodeIgniter applications, like ExpressionEngine.
=======

This repository holds server configuration files for enabling friendly urls in CodeIgniter and ExpressionEngine.
Currently you may find Apache and Lighttpd configuration files to remove "index.php" in ExpressionEngine.

By default, CodeIgniter and ExpressionEngine use the index.php file to route requests.

For SEO purposes this does not work and only extends the lenght of the URL unnecessary.
